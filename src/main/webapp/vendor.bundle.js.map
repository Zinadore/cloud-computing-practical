The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n * \n * ### Local Variables\n * \n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n * \n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n * \n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Change Propagation\n * \n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n * \n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n * \n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n * \n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * \n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n * \n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgForOf<T> implements DoCheck, OnChanges {\n   ngForOf: NgIterable<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTrackBy(fn: TrackByFunction<T>) {\n    if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n      if ( /** @type {?} */((<any>console)) && /** @type {?} */(( <any>console.warn))) {\n        console.warn(\n            `trackBy must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}. ` +\n            `See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.`);\n      }\n    }\n    this._trackByFn = fn;\n  }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget ngForTrackBy(): TrackByFunction<T> { return this._trackByFn; }\nprivate _differ: IterableDiffer<T>|null = null;\nprivate _trackByFn: TrackByFunction<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} _template\n * @param {?} _differs\n */\nconstructor(\nprivate _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,\nprivate _template: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>,\nprivate _differs: IterableDiffers) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTemplate(value: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>) {\n    // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n    // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n    // should be acceptable.\n    if (value) {\n      this._template = value;\n    }\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n    if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n      // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n      const /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n      if (!this._differ && value) {\n        try {\n          this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n        } catch ( /** @type {?} */e) {\n          throw new Error(\n              `Cannot find a differ supporting object '${value}' of type '${getTypeNameForDebugging(value)}'.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n * \n * ## Most common usage\n * \n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n * \n * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`\n * \n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n * \n * ## Using non-inlined `then` template\n * \n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n * \n * ## Storing conditional result in a variable\n * \n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n * \n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n * \n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n * \n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n * \n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n * \n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition;

This DSL approach to describing\n   * animations allows for a flexibility that both benefits developers and the framework.\n   *\n   * Animations work by listening on state changes that occur on an element within\n   * the template. When a state change occurs, Angular can then take advantage and animate the\n   * arc in between. This works similar to how CSS transitions work, however, by having a\n   * programmatic DSL, animations are not limited to environments that are DOM-specific.\n   * (Angular can also perform optimizations behind the scenes to make animations more performant.)\n   *\n   * For animations to be available for use, animation state changes are placed within\n   * {@link trigger animation triggers} which are housed inside of the `animations` annotation\n   * metadata. Within a trigger both {@link state state} and {@link transition transition} entries\n   * can be placed.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'animation-cmp',\n   *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',\n   *   animations: [\n   *     // this here is our animation trigger that\n   *     // will contain our state change animations.\n   *     trigger('myTriggerName', [\n   *       // the styles defined for the `on` and `off`\n   *       // states declared below are persisted on the\n   *       // element once the animation completes.\n   *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),\n   *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),\n   *\n   *       // this here is our animation that kicks off when\n   *       // this state change jump is true\n   *       transition('on => off', [\n   *         animate(\"1s\")\n   *       ])\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As depicted in the code above, a group of related animation states are all contained within\n   * an animation `trigger` (the code example above called the trigger `myTriggerName`).\n   * When a trigger is created then it can be bound onto an element within the component's\n   * template via a property prefixed by an `@` symbol followed by trigger name and an expression\n   * that\n   * is used to determine the state value for that trigger.\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->\n   * <div @myTriggerName=\"expression\">...</div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * For state changes to be executed, the `expression` value must change value from its existing\n   * value\n   * to something that we have set an animation to animate on (in the example above we are listening\n   * to a change of state between `on` and `off`).

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n * \n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n * \n * #### Syntax\n * \n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n * \n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n * \n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class SelectControlValueAccessor implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  value: any;\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_optionMap: Map<string, any> = new Map<string, any>();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_idCounter: number = 0;\n\n  onChange = (_: any) => {};\n  onTouched = () => {};\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset compareWith(fn: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean) {\n    if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error(`compareWith must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}`);\n    }\n    this._compareWith = fn;\n  }\nprivate _compareWith: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean = looseIdentical;\n/**\n * @param {?} _renderer\n * @param {?} _elementRef\n */\nconstructor(private _renderer: Renderer,\nprivate _elementRef: ElementRef) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nwriteValue(value: any): void {\n    this.value = value;\n    const /** @type {?} */ id: string|null = this._getOptionId(value);\n    if (id == null) {\n      this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n    }\n    const /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n    this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nregisterOnChange(fn: (value: any) => any): void {\n    this.onChange = (valueString: string) => {\n      this.value = valueString;\n      fn(this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n    };\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nregisterOnTouched(fn: () => any): void { this.onTouched = fn; }\n/**\n * @param {?} isDisabled\n * @return {?}\n */\nsetDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {\n    this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n  }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @return {?}\n */\n_registerOption(): string { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\n_getOptionId(value: any): string|null {\n    for (const /** @type {?} */ id of Array.from(this._optionMap.keys())) {\n      if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value)) return id;\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @param {?} valueString\n * @return {?}\n */\n_getOptionValue(valueString: string): any {\n    const /** @type {?} */ id: string = _extractId(valueString);\n    return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n * \n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n * \n * \\@howToUse \n * \n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n * \n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n * \n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n * \n * ### Adding or removing controls\n * \n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n * \n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class FormArray extends AbstractControl {\n/**\n * @param {?} controls\n * @param {?=} validator\n * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n */\nconstructor(\npublic controls: AbstractControl[], validator?: ValidatorFn|null,\n      asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn|null) {\n    super(validator || null, asyncValidator || null);\n    this._initObservables();\n    this._setUpControls();\n    this.updateValueAndValidity({onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false});\n  }\n/**\n * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @return {?}\n */\nat(index: number): AbstractControl { return this.controls[index]; }\n/**\n * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\npush(control: AbstractControl): void {\n    this.controls.push(control);\n    this._registerControl(control);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\ninsert(index: number, control: AbstractControl): void {\n    this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n\n    this._registerControl(control);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @return {?}\n */\nremoveAt(index: number): void {\n    if (this.controls[index]) this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(() => {});\n    this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Replace an existing control.\n * @param {?} index\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\nsetControl(index: number, control: AbstractControl): void {\n    if (this.controls[index]) this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(() => {});\n    this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n\n    if (control) {\n      this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n      this._registerControl(control);\n    }\n\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Length of the control array.\n * @return {?}\n */\nget length(): number { return this.controls.length; }\n/**\n *  Sets the value of the {\\@link FormArray}.

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n * \n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n * \n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n * \n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n * \n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n * \n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n * \n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n * \n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n * \n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n * \n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgModel extends NgControl implements OnChanges,\n    OnDestroy {\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_control = new FormControl();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_registered = false;\n  viewModel: any;\n\n   name: string;\n   isDisabled: boolean;\n   model: any;\n   options: {name?: string, standalone?: boolean};\n\n   update = new EventEmitter();\n/**\n * @param {?} parent\n * @param {?} validators\n * @param {?} asyncValidators\n * @param {?} valueAccessors\n */\nconstructor(  parent: ControlContainer,\n                 validators: Array<Validator|ValidatorFn>,\n                 asyncValidators: Array<AsyncValidator|AsyncValidatorFn>,\n                \n              valueAccessors: ControlValueAccessor[]) {\n                super();\n                this._parent = parent;\n                this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n                this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n                this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n              }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {\n                this._checkForErrors();\n                if (!this._registered) this._setUpControl();\n                if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                  this._updateDisabled(changes);\n                }\n\n                if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                  this._updateValue(this.model);\n                  this.viewModel = this.model;\n                }\n              }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnDestroy(): void { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget control(): FormControl { return this._control; }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget path(): string[] {\n                return this._parent ?

Each one has the following properties:\n *\n * - `path` is a string that uses the route matcher DSL.\n * - `pathMatch` is a string that specifies the matching strategy.\n * - `matcher` defines a custom strategy for path matching and supersedes `path` and `pathMatch`.\n * - `component` is a component type.\n * - `redirectTo` is the url fragment which will replace the current matched segment.\n * - `outlet` is the name of the outlet the component should be placed into.\n * - `canActivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivate} for more info.\n * - `canActivateChild` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivateChild handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivateChild} for more info.\n * - `canDeactivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanDeactivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanDeactivate} for more info.\n * - `canLoad` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanLoad handlers. See\n *   {@link CanLoad} for more info.\n * - `data` is additional data provided to the component via `ActivatedRoute`.\n * - `resolve` is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers. See {@link Resolve} for more\n *   info.\n * - `runGuardsAndResolvers` defines when guards and resovlers will be run. By default they run only\n *    when the matrix parameters of the route change. When set to `paramsOrQueryParamsChange` they\n *    will also run when query params change. And when set to `always`, they will run every time.\n * - `children` is an array of child route definitions.\n * - `loadChildren` is a reference to lazy loaded child routes. See {@link LoadChildren} for more\n *   info.\n *\n * ### Simple Configuration\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n  *  component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/bob`, the router will create the team component with the user\n * component in it.\n *\n * ### Multiple Outlets\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team\n * }, {\n *   path: 'chat/:user',\n *   component: Chat\n *   outlet: 'aux'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11(aux:chat/jim)`, the router will create the team component next to\n * the chat component. The chat component will be placed into the aux outlet.\n *\n * ### Wild Cards\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '**',\n *   component: Sink\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Regardless of where you navigate to, the router will instantiate the sink component.\n *\n * ### Redirects\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',\n *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router will change the url to\n * '/team/11/user/jim', and then will instantiate the team component with the user component\n * in it.\n *\n * If the `redirectTo` value starts with a '/', then it is an absolute redirect. E.g., if in the\n * example above we change the `redirectTo` to `/user/:name`, the result url will be '/user/jim'.\n *\n * ### Empty Path\n *\n * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'\n * any url segments. Let's look at the following configuration:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: AllUsers\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11`, the router will instantiate the AllUsers component.\n *\n * Empty-path routes can have children.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: WrapperCmp,\n *     children: [{\n *       path: 'user/:name',\n *       component: User\n *     }]\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router will instantiate the wrapper component with\n * the user component in it.\n *\n * An empty path route inherits its parent's params and data. This is because it cannot have its\n * own params, and, as a result, it often uses its parent's params and data as its own.\n *\n * ### Matching Strategy\n *\n * By default the router will look at what is left in the url, and check if it starts with\n * the specified path (e.g., `/team/11/user` starts with `team/:id`).\n *\n * We can change the matching strategy to make sure that the path covers the whole unconsumed url,\n * which is akin to `unconsumedUrl === path` or `$` regular expressions.\n *\n * This is particularly important when redirecting empty-path routes.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Since an empty path is a prefix of any url, even when navigating to '/main', the router will\n * still apply the redirect.\n *\n * If `pathMatch: full` is provided, the router will apply the redirect if and only if navigating to\n * '/'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'full',\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Componentless Routes\n *\n * It is useful at times to have the ability to share parameters between sibling components.\n *\n * Say we have two components--ChildCmp and AuxCmp--that we want to put next to each other and both\n * of them require some id parameter.\n *\n * One way to do that would be to have a bogus parent component, so both the siblings can get the id\n * parameter from it. This is not ideal. Instead, you can use a componentless route.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * So when navigating to `parent/10/(a//aux:b)`, the route will instantiate the main child and aux\n * child components next to each other. In this example, the application component\n * has to have the primary and aux outlets defined.\n *\n * The router will also merge the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the componentless parent into\n * the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the children. This is done because there is no component\n * that can inject the activated route of the componentless parent.\n *\n * This is especially useful when child components are defined as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: '', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * With this configuration in place, navigating to '/parent/10' will create the main child and aux\n * components.\n *\n * ### Lazy Loading\n *\n * Lazy loading speeds up our application load time by splitting it into multiple bundles, and\n * loading them on demand. The router is designed to make lazy loading simple and easy. Instead of\n * providing the children property, you can provide the `loadChildren` property, as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   loadChildren: 'team'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * The router will use registered NgModuleFactoryLoader to fetch an NgModule associated with 'team'.\n * Then it will extract the set of routes defined in that NgModule, and will transparently add\n * those routes to the main configuration.\n *\n * @stable use Routes\n */\nexport type Routes = Route[];\n\n/**\n * @whatItDoes Represents the results of the URL matching.\n *\n * * `consumed` is an array of the consumed URL segments.\n * * `posParams` is a map of positional parameters.\n *\n * @experimental\n */\nexport type UrlMatchResult = {\n  consumed: UrlSegment[]; posParams?: {[name: string]: UrlSegment};\n};\n\n/**\n * @whatItDoes A function matching URLs\n *\n * @description\n *\n * A custom URL matcher can be provided when a combination of `path` and `pathMatch` isn't\n * expressive enough.\n *\n * For instance, the following matcher matches html files.\n *\n * ```\n * function htmlFiles(url: UrlSegment[]) {\n *  return url.length === 1 && url[0].path.endsWith('.html') ?

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n   * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n   * done.\n   *\n   * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n   * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n   * is called with arguments, it will return an Observable. If `func` function\n   * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n   * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting\n   * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.\n   *\n   * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called\n   * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output\n   * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n   * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n   *\n   * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n   * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n   * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n   * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n   * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n   * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n   * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n   * if there is only one.\n   *\n   * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n   * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n   * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n   * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n   * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n   * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n   * will end before `func` is invoked.\n   *\n   * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n   * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n   * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n   * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n   * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n   * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n   *\n   * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n   * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n   * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n   * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n   * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n   *\n   * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n   * to the same context that output function has at call time.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n   * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n   * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n   * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n   * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n   * something went wrong.\n   *\n   * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n   * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n   * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n   * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n   * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n   * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n   * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n   *\n   * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n   * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n   * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n   * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n   *\n   * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n   * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n   * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n   * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n   * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n   * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n   * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n   *\n   * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n   * of returned function, when it is called.\n   *\n   * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n   * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n   * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n   * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n   * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n   *\n   * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n   * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n   * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n   * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n   *\n   * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n   * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n   * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n   * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n   * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n   * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n   * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n   * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n   * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n   *\n   * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n   * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n   * import * as fs from 'fs';\n   * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n   * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n   * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback

class=\"informal\">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/combineLatest.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function combineLatest<T, R>(...observables: Array<any | ObservableInput<any> |\n                                                    Array<ObservableInput<any>> |\n                                                    (((...values: Array<any>) => R)) |\n                                                    IScheduler>): Observable<R> {\n  let project: (...values: Array<any>) => R =  null;\n  let scheduler: IScheduler = null;\n\n  if (isScheduler(observables[observables.length -

// Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn<T>(this: Observable<T>, scheduler: IScheduler, delay: number = 0): Observable<T> {\n  return this.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private scheduler: IScheduler, private delay: number = 0) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\n    return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n  static dispatch(this: Action<ObserveOnMessage>, arg: ObserveOnMessage) {\n    const { notification, destination } = arg;\n    notification.observe(destination);\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              private scheduler: IScheduler,\n              private delay: number = 0) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  private scheduleMessage(notification: Notification<any>): void {\n    this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(\n      ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch,\n      this.delay,\n      new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)\n    ));\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n  }\n\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n  }\n\n  protected _complete(): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n  }\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\n  constructor(public notification: Notification<any>,\n              public destination: PartialObserver<any>) {\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/rxjs/src/operator/observeOn.ts","import { Observable, ObservableInput } from '../Observable';\nimport { FromObservable } from '../observable/FromObservable';\nimport { Operator } from '../Operator';\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\nimport { isArray } from '../util/isArray';\nimport { OuterSubscriber } from '../OuterSubscriber';\nimport { InnerSubscriber } from '../InnerSubscriber';\nimport { subscribeToResult } from '../util/subscribeToResult';\n\n/* tslint:disable:max-line-length */\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, R>(this: Observable<T>, v: ObservableInput<R>): Observable<R>;\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, T2, T3, R>(this: Observable<T>, v2: ObservableInput<T2>, v3: ObservableInput<T3>): Observable<R>;\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, T2, T3, T4, R>(this: Observable<T>, v2: ObservableInput<T2>, v3: ObservableInput<T3>, v4: ObservableInput<T4>): Observable<R>;\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, T2, T3, T4, T5, R>(this: Observable<T>, v2: ObservableInput<T2>, v3: ObservableInput<T3>, v4: ObservableInput<T4>, v5: ObservableInput<T5>): Observable<R>;\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, R>(this: Observable<T>, v2: ObservableInput<T2>, v3: ObservableInput<T3>, v4: ObservableInput<T4>, v5: ObservableInput<T5>, v6: ObservableInput<T6>): Observable<R> ;\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, R>(this: Observable<T>, ...observables: Array<ObservableInput<any> | ((...values: Array<any>) => R)>): Observable<R>;\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, R>(this: Observable<T>, array: ObservableInput<any>[]): Observable<R>;\n/* tslint:enable:max-line-length */\n\n/**\n * When any of the provided Observable emits an complete or error notification, it immediately subscribes to the next one\n * that was passed.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Execute series of Observables no matter what, even if it means swallowing errors.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/onErrorResumeNext.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as\n * arguments or as an array.

It will start re-emitting\n * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another\n * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will\n * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will\n * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore though of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive\n * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables.
